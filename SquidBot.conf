###
# Determines what error message the bot replies with when someone tries

###
squidbot.replies.noUser: I can't find %s in my user database. If you didn't\

                         user is, and you'll need to identify before this\

###
# Determines what error message the bot replies with when someone tries
# to do something that requires them to be registered but they're not

###
squidbot.replies.notRegistered: You must be registered to use this command.\

###
# Determines what error message is given when the bot is telling someone

###
squidbot.replies.noCapability: You don't have the %s capability. If you\

                               be sure that you are identified before trying\
                               again. The 'whoami' command can tell you if\
                               you're identified.

###
# Determines what generic error message is given when the bot is telling
# someone that they aren't cool enough to use the command they tried to

###
squidbot.replies.genericNoCapability: You're missing some capability you\
                                      need. This could be because you\
                                      actually possess the anti-capability\
                                      for the capability that's required of\
                                      you, or because the server provides\
                                      that anti-capability by default, or\
                                      because the global capabilities\
                                      include that anti-capability. Or, it\
                                      could be because the server or\
                                      squidbot.capabilities.default is set\
                                      to False, meaning that no commands are\
                                      allowed unless explicitly in your\
                                      capabilities. Either way, you can't do\
                                      what you want to do.
